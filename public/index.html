<!-- This file includes a basic HTML structure with a meta tag for defining the character set and viewport settings, a title tag for the page title, a link to the index.css stylesheet, and a div element with an ID of root where the React app will be rendered. The script tag at the bottom of the file loads the index.js file, which is where the React app is defined and rendered. -->
